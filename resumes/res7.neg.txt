Scenario 2: (Hypothetical case)

Nelson is the Director of a medium-sized Educational Institution offering vocational Education. He has Program Manager under him Thompson. Thompson has been with the company for over 6 years and his first job was working in a hotel Industry as Restaurant Assistant Manager. He has done his diploma in Hospitality in London. Thompson directly manages a team of around 5 Lecturers and 5 Instructors who between them are responsible for delivering the classroom lectures for various courses. Nelson’s leadership style is usually to take most operational decisions. However, if, for example, some minor changes need to be done, Nelson may allow Thompson to respond. Thompson on his own does not like taking decisions and likes to listen to the boss and if not take ideas from the subordinates.

The Institute is a prime Institute under the Government of Abu Dubai UAE and started for making the local people employable in the UAE by providing them with the skills and knowledge to take up jobs in the local companies, who have been instructed by the government to employ at least 10% of the employees as locals.

 There are some leadership approaches that sit between autocratic and democratic. These styles allow team participation up to a point. However, the manager reserves the right to make the final decision.

 Managers adopting an ‘I sell’ philosophy will try to persuade their teams to accept their viewpoint.

 Managers adopting an ‘I consult’ approach will seek the opinions of subordinates before taking a decision. This is moving closer to a democratic style of management.
